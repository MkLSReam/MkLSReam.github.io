    <th  style="color:white;"><h3>Hi Im Mark Louis M. Reambonanza and my nickname on court is lark. I was 12 years old when i learned the basketball.
	At the first training it was so difficult and there was a time that I want to quit on playing basketball. But I always think positive and every time 
	that I was trying to quit, I always think of my dream which is to become a PBA player one day. When I was starting to play basketball Im average player
	for short Im not a good player. I was so weak at all, even to dribble i can't do it. But that time I was ready to train hard to be a good player. Now I cannot 
	say that Im a good player but I can help my team to win. In 7 years playing basketball I won a 3 Championships. Some of my games are not good because we got lost
	because sometimes me and my teammates have no communication in the court. But we always keep close each other to have a chemistry.</th></h3>

  playing basketball are my parents, friends, and my Idol Kobe Bryant.</h3></th>
